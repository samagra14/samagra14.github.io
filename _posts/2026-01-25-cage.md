**tldr:** There's a specific loneliness that comes from being good at something you don't care about, and I lived in it long enough to recognize when someone else is trapped there too. Finding your thing requires collision, trying enough stuff that one of them grabs you and refuses to let go. **One third** of your waking life goes to work, which is either a tax you pay or a life you live.

Last month a friend's friend asked to get coffee. She's 26, works at a place that looks good on LinkedIn, earns money that would have seemed absurd to us at 21. She spent forty minutes circling something she couldn't name. The job was fine. The people were fine. Everything was fine. She was suffocating.

Then she asked if she should start a startup.

I've had this conversation enough times now to hear what's underneath it. The startup is a shape people reach for when they sense something is wrong and want a container for the escape. What's underneath is simpler and harder: **they're living someone else's life**. The resume makes sense. The trajectory makes sense. They made choices that were reasonable at every step, and now they're trapped in the sum of those choices, and the trap is invisible because it looks like success.

There's a specific kind of loneliness that comes from being good at something you don't care about. I know it because I've lived in it. I built systems that worked. The code was clean, the metrics moved, the people around me were impressed. I felt like I was watching myself from outside, performing competence, waiting to feel something. I kept thinking the feeling would come later, that meaning follows mastery. Turns out you can get very good at the wrong thing, and all that happens is the cage gets more comfortable.

The shift happened for me without announcement. I started noticing something about people: **everyone carries a universe inside them**. Ideas, visions, things they want to make but can't because the tools are too hard or too expensive or require years of training they'll never have time for. A whole world locked in, forever, because they can't code or can't design or can't build. Most people will die with more inside them than they ever got out.

When I saw that clearly I couldn't unsee it. It felt like a wrong worth fixing, and I was positioned to fix it. When I started working on that, the math of my days changed. I stopped calculating whether effort was worth outcome because the calculation stopped making sense. The hours disappeared into the work and I didn't notice them going, and somewhere in there I realized **the cage door had been open the whole time**.

That feeling, when you find it, is unmistakable. The work stops feeling like something you spend and starts feeling like something you inhabit. You stay up late because you want to, wake up early because you're curious what happens next. The distinction between labor and life dissolves.

One third of your waking adult life goes to work. Some people experience that third as a tax, the price of entry for the other two thirds. Others find a way to make that third count on its own terms. The gap between those two experiences is **the gap between existing and living**, and the gap is wide enough to fit a whole life inside it.

Money complicates this, and anyone pretending otherwise has never had to choose between rent and runway. But most people who say they're motivated by money are actually motivated by what money represents: security, freedom, proof that the choices made sense. And those people get outworked by someone for whom money is a byproduct of obsession rather than the goal. The useful question is what you would choose if every path paid the same.

The only way I know to close that gap is **collision**. You try things, most of them wrong, and you pay attention to how you feel. The restlessness that brought my friend's friend to coffee, the same restlessness I hear from juniors and peers and sometimes people older than me, is just distance. Distance between where they are and where they'd feel at home. The only way to close distance is to move.

I found mine by building enough wrong things that I recognized the right one when I stumbled into it. She'll find hers the same way. So will you.

*One third is a lot of life. Go find what's yours.*
