## Samagropnishad

Upanishads are texts written by ancient Indian sages based on their experiments with Nature, Cosmos and Philosophy.
They contain everything from Biology (see [Garbhopnishad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbha_Upanishad)) to Philosophy to History and Math.
The role of these Upanishads were to explain the Vedas to the common man via a Dialogue format. But most of them have been burried 
under hard Sanskrit texts and are currently inaccessible to the modern Indian.

These Upanishads have undergone changes over centuries, things have been added and subtracted as and when needed or discovered. Things have
also been modified keeping in mind the nature of society and the norms therin. I want to write a book or series of books that adapt
these Vedic texts, Puranas, Itihasas and Upanishads to the modern Indian. I want to call this book Samagropnishad.

Samagra means complete and Upanishad means dialogue. So Samagropnishad means a complete dialogue and is also based on my name Samagra.
This is gonna be a super hard project but I am up for it. First I would have to develop a deep understanding of Sanskrit so that I can 
interpret and read the original texts and then adapt them for the modern man.

The process has started I am reading multiple Sanskrit books to learn the language such as [Rachna-anuvaad-kaumudi](https://www.amazon.in/Rachnanuvad-Kaumudi-1-2-3-Kapil-Dwivedi/dp/B0BWK7KXS2) and [Anuvaad Chandrika](https://www.amazon.in/Brihad-Anuvad-Chandrika-Chakradhar-Nautial/dp/8120821157)
to get my grasp on Classical Sanskrit. I will complement this with Pt Damodar's [Sankrit Pathmala](https://www.exoticindiaart.com/book/details/ideal-for-sanskrit-reading-practice-set-of-24-volumes-old-and-rare-book-nzg586/) 
to get a sense of the Chhanda-Bhasha or Vedic Sanskrit.

The goal is to first read Mahabharat and Valmiki Ramayana in Sanskrit and then start writing Samagropnishad.

I am still thinking about the goal of Samagropnishad - Is it just presenting Sanskrit knowledge in an acceptable format?
Is it teaching people basics of Knowledges Systems? Is it teaching people how to think? Is it teaching people how to live?
Is it teaching them Science in Ancient India? Or is it teaching them Modern Science ? What would the reader achieve?

In the process, I also want to encode some new scientific stuff in Sanskrit - the Higgs Boson, Neural Nets, basics of Quantum Information Theory
and the beginnings of fundamental sciences. Sanskrit is 20k years old and since it has survived so long I am positive on it's further 
growth and I want to enable it too.

Too much to do - only one life - huh ! Someone please figure out a hyper-time-chamber.

## Buy a caravan and travel the villages of India 

India is a beautiful country with a history of over 10000 years. Globalisation today has destroyed the cultural uniqueness of people.
Everyone looks the same, everyone eats the same and everyone speaks the same. Every city will be full of people that conversate in English,
visit pubs and clubs on the weekends, eat burgers, pizzas very often and would mostly wear western clothing. 

This is however not true for the villages in India where ancient culture is still preserved and people live a simple life. Visiting some of these
villages would transport you to a bygone era. The best example of this is the [Mattur village](https://youtu.be/DmfXtwSZKNY) in Karnataka. Till date, the people of this village
speak and conversate in Sanskrit. They study Sanskrit texts, literature and paint graffitis in Sanskrit.



There are so many such villages. A few on my radar -
1. Shani Shignapur - Maharashtra : The village with no doors
2. Jambur - Gujarat: The African village in India
3. Kodinhi - Kerela: The village of twins with over 400 pairs of twins
4. Mawlynnong - Meghalaya: The cleanest village in Asia
5. Malana - Himachal Pradesh: The first democracy in the world

These villages are very remote and offer a way of life that would be a happy escape for anyone visiting them. I wish to someday buy a 
caravan and start a village tour of this country. I would like to visit these villages, stay with the people, learn about their culture
and write about it. I would also like to document the people and their way of life through photography.



## Fund Awadhi / Brajbhasha Songs with a Modern Twist

We've seen many Bollywood songs become popular, often rooted in Bhakti/Sufi traditions:
* [Rangi Sari](https://youtu.be/bSAlE_WgHxY?feature=shared)
* [Chaap Tilak](https://youtu.be/emTPIBDBb0A?feature=shared)
* [Piya Tose Naina Lage Re](https://youtu.be/tDhENbk65bE?feature=shared)
* [Hori Khele Raghubeera Awadh Ma](https://youtu.be/87FYp3YLEBM?feature=shared)

There are hundreds of such folk and devotional songs and poems hidden in these mid-century Indian languages. They beautifully capture human emotions but remain largely inaccessible. While I'm not a good singer and cannot create songs for them, perhaps AI can help bring these songs to life. If Tensorfuse becomes successful, I might have enough resources to fund these songs and share their beauty.

Here is a list of Awadhi/Brajbhasha songs that have captured my attention:

* [Kon Thagwa Nagariya Lootal Ho](https://youtu.be/6kgiD0NDQu8?feature=shared)
* [Zihaal e Miskin Makun Taghaful Duraaye Naina Banaayein Batiyan](https://youtu.be/y4orZlqdFKY)

These songs contain words that evoke calm and rustic feelings and these words have a long history of modifications:

* Naina - Brajbhasha
* Meet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Mitra (Sanskrit) -> Mitta (Prakrit) -> Meet (Awadhi))
* Preet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Priya (Sanskrit))

Would want to bring this someday to everyone.
