## Buy a caravan and travel the villages of India 

India is a beautiful country with a history of over 10000 years. Globalisation today has destroyed the cultural uniqueness of people.
Everyone looks the same, everyone eats the same and everyone speaks the same. Every city will be full of people that conversate in English,
visit pubs and clubs on the weekends, eat burgers, pizzas very often and would mostly wear western clothing. 

This is however not true for the villages in India where ancient culture is still preserved and people live a simple life. Visiting some of these
villages would transport you to a bygone era. The best example of this is the [Mattur village](https://youtu.be/DmfXtwSZKNY) in Karnataka. Till date, the people of this village
speak and conversate in Sanskrit. They study Sanskrit texts, literature and paint graffitis in Sanskrit.



There are so many such villages. A few on my radar -
1. Shani Shignapur - Maharashtra : The village with no doors
2. Jambur - Gujarat: The African village in India
3. Kodinhi - Kerela: The village of twins with over 400 pairs of twins
4. Mawlynnong - Meghalaya: The cleanest village in Asia
5. Malana - Himachal Pradesh: The first democracy in the world

These villages are very remote and offer a way of life that would be a happy escape for anyone visiting them. I wish to someday buy a 
caravan and start a village tour of this country. I would like to visit these villages, stay with the people, learn about their culture
and write about it. I would also like to document the people and their way of life through photography.



## Fund Awadhi / Brajbhasha Songs with a Modern Twist

We've seen many Bollywood songs become popular, often rooted in Bhakti/Sufi traditions:
* [Rangi Sari](https://youtu.be/bSAlE_WgHxY?feature=shared)
* [Chaap Tilak](https://youtu.be/emTPIBDBb0A?feature=shared)
* [Piya Tose Naina Lage Re](https://youtu.be/tDhENbk65bE?feature=shared)
* [Hori Khele Raghubeera Awadh Ma](https://youtu.be/87FYp3YLEBM?feature=shared)

There are hundreds of such folk and devotional songs and poems hidden in these mid-century Indian languages. They beautifully capture human emotions but remain largely inaccessible. While I'm not a good singer and cannot create songs for them, perhaps AI can help bring these songs to life. If Tensorfuse becomes successful, I might have enough resources to fund these songs and share their beauty.

Here is a list of Awadhi/Brajbhasha songs that have captured my attention:

* [Kon Thagwa Nagariya Lootal Ho](https://youtu.be/6kgiD0NDQu8?feature=shared)
* [Zihaal e Miskin Makun Taghaful Duraaye Naina Banaayein Batiyan](https://youtu.be/y4orZlqdFKY)

These songs contain words that evoke calm and rustic feelings and these words have a long history of modifications:

* Naina - Brajbhasha
* Meet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Mitra (Sanskrit) -> Mitta (Prakrit) -> Meet (Awadhi))
* Preet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Priya (Sanskrit))

Would want to bring this someday to everyone.
