## Fund Awadhi / Brajbhasha Songs with a Modern Twist

We've seen many Bollywood songs become popular, often rooted in Bhakti/Sufi traditions:
* [Rangi Sari](https://youtu.be/bSAlE_WgHxY?feature=shared)
* [Chaap Tilak](https://youtu.be/emTPIBDBb0A?feature=shared)
* [Piya Tose Naina Lage Re](https://youtu.be/tDhENbk65bE?feature=shared)
* [Hori Khele Raghubeera Awadh Ma](https://youtu.be/87FYp3YLEBM?feature=shared)

There are hundreds of such folk and devotional songs and poems hidden in these mid-century Indian languages. They beautifully capture human emotions but remain largely inaccessible. While I'm not a good singer and cannot create songs for them, perhaps AI can help bring these songs to life. If Tensorfuse becomes successful, I might have enough resources to fund these songs and share their beauty.

Here is a list of Awadhi/Brajbhasha songs that have captured my attention:

* [Kon Thagwa Nagariya Lootal Ho](https://youtu.be/6kgiD0NDQu8?feature=shared)
* [Zihaal e Miskin Makun Taghaful Duraaye Naina Banaayein Batiyan](https://youtu.be/y4orZlqdFKY)

These songs contain words that evoke calm and rustic feelings and these words have a long history of modifications:

* Naina - Brajbhasha
* Meet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Mitra (Sanskrit) -> Mitta (Prakrit) -> Meet (Awadhi))
* Preet - Awadhi/Brajbhasha (Priya (Sanskrit))

Would want to bring this someday to everyone.
